## Previous versions

### Summary

- Version [0.7.0] on August 30, 2021 was the first time that the OG-USA repository was detached from all of the core model logic, which was named OG-Core. Before this version, OG-USA was part of what is now the [`OG-Core`](https://github.com/PSLmodels/OG-Core) repository. In the next version of OG-USA, we adjusted the version numbering to begin with 0.1.0. This initial version of 0.7.0, was sequential from what OG-USA used to be when the OG-Core project was called OG-USA.
- Any earlier versions of OG-USA can be found in the [`OG-Core`](https://github.com/PSLmodels/OG-Core) repository [release history](https://github.com/PSLmodels/OG-Core/releases) from [v.0.6.4](https://github.com/PSLmodels/OG-Core/releases/tag/v0.6.4) (Jul. 20, 2021) or earlier.
